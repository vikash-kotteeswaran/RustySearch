-- Implementation --

- Writes
    - Talk to Coordinator
    - Coordinator generates Index Key
    - Coordinator identifies Appropriate Node (Shard) using Index Key
    - Appropriate Shard PreProcesses and Indexes in them
    - Appropriate Shard modifies Node Lookup Table if Neccessary and broadcasts the Patch to other Nodes
    - Returns back to Coordinator and Coordinator sends a response

- Reads
    - Talk to Coordinator
    - Get Relevant Nodes from Node Lookup Table
    - Send the Search Words to the Relevant Nodes
    - Relevant Nodes gets the relevant 'Index Keys', computes Relevance Scores and returns to Coordinator
    - Coordinator aggregates the results and sends back as Response
