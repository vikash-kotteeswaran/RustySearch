-- Architecture --

- Index Cluster
  - Index Node
    - Sharded Index
      - Master
      - Slave
      - Coordinator
    - Node Lookup Table

__Sharded Index__
- Radix Trie
- Writes are directed to Master
- Reads are served from both Master and Slave

__Coordinator Sharded Index__
- Coordinator is in itself/serves as a Master Sharded Index
- Receives the Search request
- Finds relevant Index Nodes from Node Lookup Table
- Aggregates results from relevant nodes and sends as Response
- Coordindator is switched to another Master Shard if the current Coordinator is not available

__Index Node__
- Consists of a Master Sharded Index and Several Replicas of other Master Sharded Indexes

__Node Lookup Table__
- Same Node Lookup Table is present in each of the Index Nodes to identify Relevant Nodes around a particular node.

__Index Cluster__
- Consists of all the Index Nodes
