-- Requirements --

- Indexability
- Fault Toleratability
- Distributability
- High-Throughput

__Indexability__

- Entities Being Indexed are primary keyed separately into 'Index Key'
- Fuzzy Search Retrieval of Relevant Entities with Relevance Scores.

__Fault Tolerability__
- Tunable Number of Replicas for a Master Sharded Index
- Increasing Distance between Master Shards and Slave Shards
- Durable Writes by Logging Unindexed Changes

__Distributability__

- Eventual Consitency with Sharded Replicas

__High-Throughput__
- Appropriate number of Shard Indexes
- Efficient Disk Writes from Buffers and Flushing
- Faster PreProcessing
- Efficient Searching through Node Lookup tables
